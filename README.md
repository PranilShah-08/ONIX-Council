# ONIX Council – Collaborative Intelligence Interface

AI Council is a local, interactive web application that lets you ask a question not to a single language model, but to a **council of models** working together.

Instead of relying on one opinion, this project orchestrates multiple models to **deliberate, critique, refine, and finally agree** on a response—much like a panel of experts guided by a chairman.

The result is a more thoughtful, balanced, and well-reasoned answer.

## Core Idea

Most applications send a prompt to a single provider and return the first response.

This project takes a different approach:

- Multiple models receive the same question
- They iteratively review and refine a shared draft
- Each model must explicitly agree before consensus is reached
- A designated **Chairman** produces the final authoritative answer
- Individual member feedback is preserved for transparency

All of this happens live in a clean, ChatGPT-like interface.

## How It Works

When you submit a query, the system follows these stages:

### **Stage 1: Initial Deliberation**
Each council member reviews the topic and contributes to a shared draft.  
If a member is satisfied, they explicitly confirm it.  
If not, they improve the draft.

This continues iteratively until consensus is reached or a maximum number of rounds is hit.

---

### **Stage 2: Consensus Check**
The system ensures **all members are satisfied** with the draft.  
Only when unanimous agreement is achieved does the process move forward.

This prevents premature or low-quality conclusions.

---

### **Stage 3: Chairman’s Final Decision**
Once consensus exists, the Chairman:
- Improves clarity
- Removes redundancy
- Produces a final, polished response

This answer is presented as the official outcome.

---

### **Stage 4: Individual Final Feedback**
Each council member provides:
- Agreement status
- One strength of the final answer
- One limitation or caveat (if any)

This preserves accountability and insight diversity.

## 🖥️ User Interface

The application uses a three-panel layout:

- **Left Panel** – Live deliberation stream
- **Center Panel** – Chairman’s final answer
- **Right Panel** – Individual member feedback

Previous questions are stored in-session for quick reference.
